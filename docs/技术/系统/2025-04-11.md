# Run Docker on Windows

It is my first blog write in English.  
If there's anything wrong please inform me...:smile:
---
## Preview
If you are using Linux or MacOS in your computer, there are certain circumstances that you need Windows to run some applications or for development use.  
And to run windows in other systems there are often three ways:
  
- [ ] Install Windows and get dual system
- [ ] Run Windows with VMs(Virtual Machine)
- [x] Run Windows in Docker

!!!note
    We are mainly dealing with docker in this tutorial.But I'd like to show you the advantages and disadvantages of each method before we start so that you can make a better choice.  
  
If you knows what you are doing, just skip to the next part.

> Install Windows and get dual system

The only but fatal disadvantage of this method is that usually , you have to restart your computer to exit the current system and get into windows.The advantage is obvious since you are running a real windows physically, you got all your hardwares working for a better performance.  

> Run Windows with VMs

This is more convinient than restart your computer. A Virtual Machine monitors the hardware, so that you're running your windows quite seperately.The disadvantage is that you waste your RAM and CPUs for running the VMs, so that it can slow down both inside and outside the VMs. And the installing process can be quite complex.  

> Run Windows in Docker

This aproach is what we concentrate on today.Using Docker, your get a rather seperated environment to run programs smoothly. Docker is like a container that provide just the amount of dependencies that you need. It's the best choice if you don't have a wonderful computer.

???success "Quick choose"
    If you don't mind restart everytime you want to use Windows, choose "Install Windows and get dual system"  
    If you have a good computer and a good tutorial, choose VMs  
    If you just want to run some windows applications, try docker.

## Qick Start
!!!tip 
    Two ingredients are all we need: <font color=cyen>Docker Engine</font> and a <font color=cyen>RDP server</font>.
### Docker Engine
> What is [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/):

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications.  

!!!warning "It is highly recommended to install docker engine from the [official webite](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), where you can learn more."

To learn more about docker, see this article ---> [What is Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview/).  

- [x] Follow the steps from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and install docker.  

- [x] To check if you have installed docker, try this:

```bash
docker --version
```
You should see something like this:
```
Docker version 28.0.4, build b8034c0
```

- [x] To check if everything is working perfectly, try this:
  
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
You should see something start with:
```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```
!!!tip 
    <font size=4>If you successfully installed docker( have the version information ) but failed to run hello-world due to some internet issues:
    Try `sudo` first !</font>

Only when you have your docker engine installed and working, follow the next steps.  

### Windows in Docker
> Reference Tutorial: [docker-windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows)  

I will introduce two ways to install Windows in docker, choose the one fits your need.

#### Via Docker CLI 
CLI stands for command-line interface. It is the easiest way to have windows run in your docker, just copy the following command into your terminal:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name windows -p 8006:8006 --device=/dev/kvm --device=/dev/net/tun --cap-add NET_ADMIN -v ${PWD:-.}/windows:/storage --stop-timeout 120 dockurr/windows
```
!!!note "<font size =4 >But before you run it let me explain the command</font>"

This command starts a Docker container to run Windows VM using KVM/QEMU virtualization. It enables hardware acceleration, network bridging, and persistent storage.
> Key Parameters

`-it` : Runs the container in interactive mode.  
`--rm` : Automatically removes the container when it exits (avoids leftover containers).  
`--name windows` : Assigns the name windows to the container.  
`-p 8006:8006` : Set port so that you can access the container at port 8006 (don't change it)  
`--device=/dev/kvm` : Use KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for hardware-accelerated virtualization.  
`--device=/dev/net/tun` : Use TUN/TAP, enabling bridged or NAT networking for the VM.  
`--cap-add NET_ADMIN` : Gives the container network administration privileges.  
`-v ${PWD:-.}/windows:/storage` : Use ./windows to store the VM (you can change the directory).  
`--stop-timeout 120` : Allows 120s for the VM to shut down safely.  
`dockurr/windows` :  The Docker image designed for running Windows VMs.

!!!note "<font size =4 >Basically you can just copy the command.</font>"

> How to use

When you run the command, docker first download an image of windows. And after pulling the image, it will start the service.Then, move to your browsers and go to `http://[your_localhost]:8006`. You will see the process of installing windows and so on.  
Just wait a few minutes till the process automatically finish. Then you got windows in your browser.

#### Via Docker Compose

To personalize your Windows VM, it is more recommanded to use `docker compose` than the previous command. Follow the steps:

- [x] Create a folder for your Windows storage, in my case it's `./windows`.
- [x] Enter the folder and build a `compose.yaml` file in it. 
- [x] Create two more folders: `data` and `share`. 

```text title="The structure of ./windows"
.
├── compose.yaml
├── data
└── share
```

- [x] Paste these into the compose file:

```yaml
services:
  windows:
    image: dockurr/windows
    container_name: windows
    environment:
      VERSION: "11"  # your windows version
      RAM_SIZE: "3G"  # the RAM size for your windows
      CPU_CORES: "4"  # the number of CPU cores for your windows
      DISK_SIZE: "125G"  # the disk size for your windows
    devices:
      - /dev/kvm
      - /dev/net/tun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - 8006:8006
      - 3389:3389/tcp
      - 3389:3389/udp
    volumes:
      - ./share:/data  # mount the share folder
      - ./data:/storage  # mount the storage folder
    restart: always
    stop_grace_period: 2m
```
!!!info 
    <font size=4>Feel free to customize the options with my comments. Unless you know what you're doing, paste the others.  
    `./share:/data` means you mount `./share` in your current folder to `/data` in the Windows VM so that you can exchange files between the two systems through this folder.  
    `./data:/storage` means you use `./data` in your current folder to store your Windows.</font>

- [x] Save the compose file and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Docker will download all the things. In the end you will see something like this:
```bash title="Output"
[+] Running 1/1
 ✔ Container windows  Running                                              1.0s 
```
It means docker have finished its job. Now the Windows will start installing and initializing by itself.  
Again you can check the progress through your browser at `http://[your_localhost]:8006`. And you can start using it when it finishes initializing.  

!!!tip 
    <font size=4>Using Windows in your browser maybe quite slow and you don't have audio and paste.  
    We're using RDP to solve that problem .</font>

### Using RDP
Now you already have Windows running and ready at port 8006. We're using the RDP server to make you more convinient to use.
> Introducing RDP ( see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) )

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft Corporation which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.

!!!note "<font size=4>In a word, RDP is good.</font>"

> Install RDP

There're lots of RDP client you can use. If you're using Linux, I recommand [Remmina](https://remmina.org/how-to-install-remmina/#snap).  If you're using MacOS, [Windows APP Mobile](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/windows-app-mobile/id714464092?l=en-GB) will be good.

> Access Your Windows

I use Remmina as an example.  

- [x] Open Remmina and create a new connection ( the bottom at upper-left coerner )

![example](images/2025-04-15%2020-38-28%20的屏幕截图.png)
The server name should be `[your_localhost]:3389`  
The Window's default user is `docker`, the pssword be `admin`

- [x] Save the setting and launch to connect.

> Where to find the share folder

Your will find it at `network -> host.lan -> Data` in Windows  
!!!note "<font size=4>Now you can enjoy your Windows</font>"
